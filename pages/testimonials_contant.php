                    <p>Thank you for making it so easy. You had the lowest fare and the BEST CONNECTIONS!! And I love the way I can view the itinerary and put payment info on the same page! I could just scroll up to double check everything was correct and as I thought it was. So count me in as a your new fan. The nex time I travel, I'll check with you guys first!</p>

                    <p>I have been trying for 2 days to purchase a ticket from Travelocity with no luck and a lot of frustration. I decided to use you guys on a whim and had my ticket for my son in 2 minutes! I just want to let you know it was a pleasure to use your company. I now get to have him here for Mothers Day!!!</p>

                    <p>I am so ridiculously impressed that you/your company would do such a thing as lower my ticket price when the fare dropped, despite the fact that I've already paid for it. I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. You guys rock! Thanks so much.
